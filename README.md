# ðŸŽ§ Smart Shuffle Engagement Analysis

This project is a **simulated case study inspired by Spotify's data analyst workflows**. It analyzes how the rollout of a fictional feature â€” *Smart Shuffle* â€” affects user engagement metrics like session length and skip rate.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Compare user behavior with vs. without Smart Shuffle enabled
- Explore trends by region and user type (Premium vs Free)
- Identify the most impacted user segments
- Visualize engagement trends to support product decision-making

---

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

- Simulated user session data
- Columns: `user_id`, `region`, `is_premium`, `smart_shuffle_enabled`, `session_length`, `skips`, `timestamp`
- Stored in `/data/mock_smart_shuffle_data.csv`

---

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub for version control

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Questions Explored

- Does Smart Shuffle increase session length?
- Do Premium users respond differently than Free users?
- Are certain regions more receptive to the feature?
- How does Smart Shuffle affect skip rates?

## âœ… Next Steps

- Add charts (boxplots, bar plots, scatter plots)
- Summarize insights in markdown inside the notebook
- Push cleaned notebook and update this README
